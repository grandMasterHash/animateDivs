animateDivs
===========

A javascript file containing object definitions for animating arrays of divs in visually interesting formations.
Only a couple of different layouts have been defined. There is room for any layout of animated divs you can think of.
For an example of what is possible with the current state of the project, see: www.jeremyestrada.com
